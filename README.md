# Connect4 in Javascript
This is a Connect 4 game written entirely in Javascript.

## Background
This program was created after working with Javascript for two months.
I created it for a high school project, and the Sinclair Capstone Competition. The project won second place in its category.

It was a group project. I wrote the code, the graphics were designed by Ryan Wise.
